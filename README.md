# semantic-html

## Objectives

The objective of this lesson was to replace generic div tags with more descriptive, semantic tags.
After changing tags in the HTML, I needed to also change some things in the CSS file in order for the page to render properly.
I also commented out some code that seemed redundant, and was able to include it in another line, shortening the code.
